<b>microMVP - an Open Source Multi-Vehicle Platform</b></font> -  
 We are developing a differential driver based micro multi-vehicle system 
called microMVP. The platform is a complete platfrom with a (mainly) 
Arduino-based hardware stack and a Python-based software stack. The platform
is low cost (a complete system with six vehicles costs a few hundred USD) and
scalable (supporting at least a few tens of vehicles). Please refer to 
the dedicated 
<a href="https://arc.cs.rutgers.edu/mvp" target="_">platform page</a>
for details. The platform is fully open source. <br><br>

<font color='MAROON'><b>Short Bio</b></font> - I am an Assistant Professor 
leading the Algorithmic Robotics and Control Lab in the Department of 
Computer Science at Rutgers. 
Prior to joining Rutgers, I spent two years as 
a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a>
with <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/876">Daniela Rus</a> in the 
<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Distributed Robotics Lab</a>. 
The first year of the two-year postdoctoral appointment was joint at 
<a href="http://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</a>
with 
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/">Mac Schwager</a> 
in the 
<a href="https://msl.stanford.edu/">Multirobot Systems Lab</a>. 
<br><br>
I obtained my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
<a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>
working with 
<a href="http://msl.cs.illinois.edu/~lavalle/">Steven M. LaValle</a>. 
After defending my thesis, I stayed briefly at the
<a href="https://csl.illinois.edu/">Coordinated Science Laboratory</a>
as a postdoctoral researcher working with 
<a href="http://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/sjchung">Soon-Jo Chung</a>
and 
<a href="https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/voulgari">Petros G. Voulgaris</a>.<br><br>

I completed my undergraduate study at the 
<a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a>.<br><br>

<font color='MAROON'><b>Prospective Students</b></font> - 
I always look to working with motivated prospective students interested in 
fundamental and/or applied research in robotics and control. 
If you are interested in joining my group, please read some of our recent 
papers and let me know if you find them interesting (and tell me why). <br><br>
