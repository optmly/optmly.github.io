### Short Bio

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University 
at New Brunswick. 
I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois
working with [Steven M. LaValle](http://lavalle.pl/).
Prior to joining Rutgers, I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at MIT working 
[Daniela Rus](https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/876) with the first year split at Boston 
University with [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/). 
I also stayed briefly at the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois 
as a postdoctoral researcher, working with 
[Soon-Jo Chung](http://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/sjchung)
and [Petros G. Voulgaris](https://www.unr.edu/me/people/petros-voulgaris).
I completed my undergraduate study at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

I am a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and the Amazon Research Award in Robotics.
